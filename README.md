Hi! My name is Kurtis! Lazipops is jus my online handle but you can call me either or! I'm graduating from software development from my local college soon. I've been 
most interested in web developement so much so that I plan to create a project that builds on what I've been doing for my capstone called Collectrio. In short, 
I plan for the final product to be a rom distrubution site and retro gaming resource that have resources like video game emulators that include consoles like Xbox, Gamecube, ect
as well as old games for users to download. If you have any questions, send me a message about it!
